# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Content Clustering using Unsupervised Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project applies **Unsupervised Machine Learning and NLP techniques** to cluster Netflix content (movies and TV shows) based on their textual descriptions and metadata. It helps identify content groupings for potential recommendation systems and market segmentation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To explore the Netflix dataset through EDA and use clustering (KMeans and Hierarchical) based on TF-IDF of content descriptions to uncover hidden patterns in genre, type, and release trends.

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Text Preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- KMeans Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Silhouette Score Evaluation

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- Content shifted significantly toward TV Shows post-2015.
- TF-IDF-based clusters revealed thematic groupings (e.g., action-heavy, romantic, documentary).
- KMeans provided 3â€“5 optimal content clusters with strong intra-group similarity.
